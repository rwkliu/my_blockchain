## Description
The high level execution sequence is as follows:
1. Prompt user for input
2. Parse the input
3. Execute the command
4. Repeat 1. unless the quit command is entered

## Installation
To compile the program, run make to generate the executable file my_blockchain.

## Usage

* add: add node or block to the blockchain
* rm: remove node or block from the blockchain
* ls: list all nodes by their identifiers (nid). If -l is specified, all blocks associated with the node is listed
